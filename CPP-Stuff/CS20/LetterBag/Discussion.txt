The only advantages of using an array are easy clearing and printing. For LetterBag1, setting the size to 0 clears the array. For LetterBag2, the bag can't be cleared until 
all the counts are reset, which requires more work. More empty checks for each function would remove this issue, but I'm happy enough with the results. 
Printing is easy for the array since I just had to loop through the array. For the dictionary, I had to go through each letter and print the letter once for each count. 
The dictionary beats the array in every way. All the functions were faster and easier to implement.
